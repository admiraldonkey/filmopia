# Reflecton

## What requirements did you achieve?

All

## Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

None

## If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

N/A

## What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

Forgot to add the environment variables when deploying the server. Error messages were somewhat unhelpful to figuring out the reason and let me on quite the merry goose chase! Thankfully Heinry pointed it out and saved me from any further frustration.

## What went really well and what could have gone better?

Some of the CSS was driving me mad and just refused to do what I wanted. Thankfully managed to fix it by adopting flex (again). Think from now on I'm just going to use flex for everything!
